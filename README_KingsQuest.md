# Version of the game

King's Quest v.1.0

## Description

When Kingâ€™s Quest I was released in 1984, its key selling point was the use of non-static screens which responded dynamically to player input. For instance, the player could move the character in realtime. This is part of a tutorial, I do not own the visuals of the game.

This tutorial helped me:

  - Learn what is a RequiredComponent.

  - Sorting 2D Sprites.

  - Parsing Commands.

  - Add interactable objects.
