# Version of the game

Sheep Rescue v.1.0

## Description

Shoot hay in order to rescue sheeps and get the highest score possible, if you miss 3 sheeps you lose. This is part of a tutorial, I do not own the visuals of the game.

Even if I knew how to do pretty much everything, this tutorial helped me:

· Remember that I need to delete things of a list not just destroy the gameObjects.
· Know that you can cache a Script by equaling a public static Instance to "this".

· With: 
```csharp 
selectedIndex %= Enum.GetValues(typeof(HayMachineColor)).Length; 
``` 
you can loop an enum without using IFs.
